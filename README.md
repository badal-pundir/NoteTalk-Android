## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

-   **UI:** Jetpack Compose

## 🏗️ Architecture

The app follows a clean architecture pattern, separating concerns into distinct layers:

-   **UI Layer:** Displays application data on the screen and handles user interaction.
-   **ViewModel Layer:** Manages UI-related state and exposes it to the UI.
-   **Repository Layer:** Acts as a single source of truth for data, abstracting the data source from the ViewModel.
-   **Data Layer:** Handles data persistence using the Room database.
